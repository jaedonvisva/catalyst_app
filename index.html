            <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <p>
              Technology has always been my passion in life. I am known amongst
              my friends, family and teachers to be the resident tech expert who
              is remarkable at solving technical problems. Computers have
              intrigued me since I was as young as 5 years old, and I started to
              learn how to code when I was 7. Since then, I have learned
              multiple programming languages, such as Python, and web design
              languages such as HTML and CSS, and JavaScript. My parents have
              always taught me to think big and that to be an achiever, I must
              be a believer. They encourage me to not just be a user of
              technology, but to be an innovator. I am inspired by my favourite
              show Shark Tank, and my dream is to pitch my own technological
              invention on that show one day, one that provides a solution to a
              problem that is currently not solvable by human intelligence. I look to create solutions to the security threat that we face today, and use conputer vision and machine learning to do so. When
              I look at how much technology, especially artificial intelligence,
              is influencing our lives in the current digital world of
              self-driving cars and robots performing surgeries, I often wonder
              what the world would be like in the next 10-15 years. I want to be
              a valuable innovative contributor in that world. Being part of the
              Catalyst would also provide me with a great opportunity to be with
              students who are ambitious, have similar interests, goals, hopes
              and dreams and who see the world through the same technological
              lens as I do. I strongly believe that the Catalyst program would
              prove to be a resourceful and nurturing leadership learning
              environment for me and will be a big stepping stone in making my
              dream of being in Shark Tank, come true one day. I am excited to
              be part of the next generation of thinkers and innovators.
